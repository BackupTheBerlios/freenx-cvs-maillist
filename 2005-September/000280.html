+This annoucement is inspired by the &quot;Marketing for Geeks&quot; guide, which 
+was recently showcasted by Aaron and Waldo at akademy 2005, the KDE 
+contributor conference in Malaga/Spain.

+Malaga, 30th August, aKademy 2005 conference.
 
-This release features for you:
+The FreeNX Developer Team is proud to release a new version of FreeNX,
+the remote desktop access software. 
 
-* Easiest installation ever
+* FreeNX is known to work on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris. 
+* FreeNX provides efficient access to remote applications with a 
+  graphical user interface (GUI). 
+* FreeNX works well even over dialup modem links. 
+* FreeNX connects client computers to Linux or Unix GUI applications
+  as well as to MS Windows. 
+* FreeNX works very well with the NoMachine NX Client (available for 
+  Linux, Windows and Solaris). 
+  
 
-* Work better, faster, and more colorful (NX 1.5.0)
-	* Resizable Desktop.
-	* Fast single application mode.
-	* Truecolor Windows Sessions.
 
-* Use it in restricted environments
+What FreeNX can do for different users -- some real world use cases:
+====================================================================
 
-* Easily get help for your problems
+* a travelling salesman can access his own desktop (at home or at his
+  offic) from the hotel room, using a modem (or better) connection.
 
-* Better support for big corporate environments
+* a helpdesk technician can display any GUI application of a LAN user
+  to his own screen and help to properly set up its configuration or
+  troubleshoot it.
 
-* Lots of bugfixes, more stability and improved security
+* a university system administrator can set up a cost efficient and
+  Linux Desktop Application Server for students to connect to from
+  classes or from home.
 
+* a KDE developer can showcase his latest code to co-maintainers and
+  usability experts in action without them needing to compile it by
+  themselves.
+
+* an IT consultancy company can offer its customers more flexible
+  scenarios when planning and implementing migrations from MS Windows
+  to Linux. 
+
+
+What parts FreeNX is composed of:
+=================================
+
+The FreeNX remote desktop server software *requires* the NX Core 
+components developed by NoMachine.com who have released that source
+code under the GPL license. 
+
+The NoMachine source code needs to be compiled for your platform by 
+yourself or by your Linux distribution so that FreeNX can work. 
+NoMachine Core NX components are available in version 1.4.0 or 1.5.0. 
+We recommend to use 1.5.0 for better performance and more features. 
+
+NoMachine also offer a commercial package of ready-made NX server 
+software for several OS platforms, including support and several 
+add-ons useful for enterprise level installations.
+
+
+What improvements this release brings to current FreeNX users:
+==============================================================
+
+* it now sports the most easy installation we ever had
+* it now works better and faster than ever, and is more colorful
+* it now has a resizable remote desktop
+* it now has a fast single application mode
+* it now supports truecolor remote MS Windows sessions
+* it now can be installed without having root privileges
+* it is now easier to troubleshoot in case of problems
+* it now better supports big corporate environments
+* it contains many fixes for known bugs
+* it is more stable than previous releases
+* it has been improved on security
+
+
 And last but not least:
 
-THE
+* FreeNX 0.5.0 ships with the first official FreeNX background picture
+  (useful as a wallpaper)

+[&quot;The upcoming NX4Myhome which I had the pleasure to preview, will help 
+FreeNX to conquer the market of ssh-X. FreeNX is just so much faster. 
+I compared the output of a big textfile via cat, NX was 3 times as 
+fast than a normal ssh connection.&quot;]

 Now let us give you some details about the new release:
 
+
 Easiest installation ever
 -------------------------
 
-The setup program of FreeNX 0.4.5 is now interactive, checks for a correct configuration and has automatic self-tests and a help system.
+The &quot;nxsetup&quot; program of FreeNX 0.4.5 now...
+  ...works by default in an interactive way
+  ...checks for a correct configuration 
+  ...conducts automatic self-tests 
+  ...offers a help system.
 
-Important changes:
+Important changes compared to previous releases:
 
-* nxsetup is now interactive. Use --auto to disable this.
-* NoMachine key is now the default, but the user still has to confirm it.
-  [FIXME]
-* nxsetup checks for a correct configuration file. Use --ignore-errors to continue nxsetup even when the check fails.
-* If the automatic self-test fails nxsetup reminds the user of some common pitfalls.
+* since &quot;nxsetup&quot; is now interactive, there is a &quot;--auto&quot; commandline 
+  parameter to support the old behaviour you may be accustomed to
+* since &quot;nxsetup&quot; now uses the NoMachine key by default, the user

+* since &quot;nxsetup&quot; now runs an automatic self-test, it also reminds the 
+  user of some common pitfalls.
 
-Work better, faster, and more colorful (NX 1.5.0)
--------------------------------------------------
 
-FreeNX 0.4.5 has full support for the most important 1.5.0 features.
+Better, faster, and more colorful (NX 1.5.0)
+--------------------------------------------
 
-Your virtual Desktop is now resizable. Just drag the borders and if you want to switch to/from fullscreen mode just press Ctrl+Alt+F.
+FreeNX 0.4.5 has full support for the most important features 
+introduced into the 1.5.0 NoMachine Core NX components (not working
+with the 1.4.0 version):
 
-FreeNX 0.4.5 supports the fast single application mode. To enable this feature, set ENABLE_ROOTLESS_MODE=&quot;1&quot; in node.conf. From your client select a Unix-Custom &quot;Floating windows&quot; session and booh: You are up and running remote applications blazingly fast. 
+* your full remote desktop is now resizable if displayed in windowed 
+  mode.  Just drag the borders with the mouse to change its size.
+* your full remote desktop can now easily toggled between windowed and
+  fullscreen  mode. Just press the key combination [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[f].
+* your remote single application windows now supports the same fast
+  speed that the full remote desktop always had. To use this feature...
+    ...on the FreeNX-0.4.5 server set ENABLE_ROOTLESS_MODE=&quot;1&quot; in the 
+       &quot;node.conf&quot; configuration file, and
+    ...in the NoMachine NX Client follow these steps:
+       --&gt; click &quot;Configure...&quot;
+       --&gt; select the &quot;General&quot; tab
+       --&gt; locate and go to the &quot;Desktop&quot; box (middle box)
+       --&gt; select &quot;Unix&quot; and &quot;Custom&quot; session type
+       --&gt; click &quot;Settings...&quot;
+       --&gt; enable &quot;Run the following command&quot; radio button
+       --&gt; type in the application's startup command, click &quot;OK&quot; twice
+           and login. 
+* your remote access to Windows Terminal Server sessions can now be run
+  in &quot;Truecolor&quot; mode. Just use the 1.5.0 version of the NoMachine NX 
+  Client and follow these steps to set it up:
+       --&gt; click &quot;Configure...&quot;
+       --&gt; select the &quot;General&quot; tab
+       --&gt; locate and go to the &quot;Desktop&quot; box (middle box)
+       --&gt; select the &quot;Windows&quot; session type 
+       --&gt; locate and go to the &quot;Display&quot; box (bottom box)
+       --&gt; select &quot;Use custom settings&quot;
+       --&gt; click &quot;Modify...&quot;
+       --&gt; locate and go to the &quot;Allowed colors&quot; box (top box)
+       --&gt; move the slider to the &quot;16M&quot; position
 
-Truecolor Windows Sessions are now supported by FreeNX. Just use the 1.5.0 client and select from the Display-box &quot;Use custom settings, Modify, Allowed Colors '16M'&quot;.
 
-Use FreeNX in restricted environments
--------------------------------------
+Install FreeNX without root privileges (usermode installation)
+--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Imagine the following scenario:
 
-You have a really nice remote access to a machine in your company and you would love to use FreeNX to do your everyday work. But the problem is: You do not have root access and so you can't use it. FreeNX 0.4.5 enables you do to it nevertheless.
+* you have a user account on a Linux machine where you can run a KDE
+  desktop if you sit in front of it
+* you can remotely access the machine via an SSH login in shell-only
+  mode
+* you do not possess root privileges on the machine, and therefor you
+  cannot install the standard FreeNX server.
 
-You can install FreeNX 0.4.5 in a special mode to access it directly via your user account. The only problem remaining is patching the client and setting it all up.
+FreeNX-0.4.5 now supports a &quot;usermode&quot; installation via remote SSH 
+access into your home directory. 
 
-Fux has explained this in detail in a howto available from:
+FreeNX Development Team member Thorsten Sandfuchs has explained the
+steps to follow in detail in a separate HOWTO. It is available from:

-FreeNX plans to ship ready-made plug-and-play binary distributions of NX4MyHome as soon as all tests are finished.
+The FreeNX Development Team plans to ship ready-made binary packages
+of this option (probably named &quot;NX4MyHome&quot;) which support a more easy
+mode of installation as soon as all tests are finished. For now you 
+have to follow the instructions supplied by the link above.
 
-Easily get help for your problems
----------------------------------
 
-We have several scenarios that come up over and over again. There are many different distributions all doing things a bit different. But you can't give &quot;test this&quot; and &quot;test that&quot; instructions without knowing a lot about the environment of the user.
+Easier troubleshooting in case of problems
+------------------------------------------
 
-For example starting up nxagent over a ssh -X connection to test if the basic functionality works can now be done via:
+In the past FreeNX users experienced several problem scenarios that 
+came up over and over again. There are many different distributions
+shipping FreeNX packaged by them, each doing things a bit different. 
+But we can't give detailed &quot;test this&quot; and &quot;do that&quot; instructions 
+without knowing a lot about the environment of a user experiencing
+problems with the FreeNX package provided by his distro.
 
-nxserver --agent :1000
+For example starting up nxagent over a ssh -X connection to test if 
+the basic functionality works can now be done with this simple command:
 
-instead of:
+   nxserver --agent :1000
 
-LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/where/nx/libs/live /where/nxagent/is :1000
+instead of formerly:
 
-It should now be a lot easier to give advise.
+   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/nxlibs/dir /path/to/nxagent :1000
 
+It should now be a lot easier to give advice in case of problems.
+
+
 Better support for big corporate environments
 ---------------------------------------------
 
-Thanks to the help of Google and Cisco employees FreeNX does now work also in environments where you have 1000 users or more.
+Thanks to help and patches of Google and Cisco employees, FreeNX now 
+does work also in environments where there are 1000 users or more.
 
-Technically speaking: getent does no longer retrieve the whole database and grep through it, but directly query for the information needed.
+The previous authentications code suffered from the flaw that it did
+retrieve the whole passwd database and grep through it to find a user. 
+Now it directly queries for the information needed using getent.
 
+
 Lots of bugfixes, more stability and improved security
 ------------------------------------------------------
 
-We also again had several bugfixes:
+This release contains several bugfixes:
 
-	* Fixed support for CUPS forwarding.
-	* Fixed resume with 1.5.0 client.
+* Fixed support for CUPS forwarding
+* Fixed resume with the 1.5.0 NoMachine NX Client
 
 Stability has been increased in the following fields:
 
-	* Reconnection support. (Yes, again)
+* Reconnection support (Yes, again)
 
 Security issues / concerns have been fixed regarding the following topics:
 
-        * Certain passwords for VNC/RDP could have been visible via `ps aux`.
-	* Privacy of passwords is assured. They are no longer shown in log files or re-transmitted to the client.
-	* $USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx is now protected.
-	* The client is no longer able to overwrite parameters set by the server.
+* Certain passwords for VNC and RDP type session under certain 
+  conditions were visible via `ps aux`. All known cases are fixed.
+* Passwords are no longer shown in log files or re-transmitted to the 
+  client.
+* ${USER_FAKE_HOME}/.nx is now protected against access by other users.
+* The NX client is no longer able to overwrite parameters set by the 
+  NX server.
  
-And last but not least:
 
-THE
-
 First official FreeNX background picture
 ----------------------------------------
 
-This release for the first time features a really nice background picture. Show your appreciation of FreeNX and use it on one of your desktops as a background. 
-
+This release for the first time ships a PNG graphic file, meant to be 
+used as a desktop wallpaper. You can now show your appreciation for 
+FreeNX by using it for at least one of your desktops as a background. 
 Whenever you show off FreeNX, be sure to use it and spread the word!
